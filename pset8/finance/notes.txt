check

Complete the implementation of check in such a way that it checks whether a username is available.

    The route should accept, via GET, an HTTP parameter called username.

    If the value of username is of length at least 1 and does not already belong to a user in the database, the route should return, in JSON format, true, signifying that the username is (as of that moment) available. Else it should return, in JSON format, false. Recall that jsonify in Flask can return a value in JSON format.

Finally, enhance your template for register with some JavaScript in such a way that it prevents submission of your registration form if the inputted username is already taken, letting the user know, as via alert or via a Bootstrap alert or validation.

    Use Ajax (e.g., jQueryâ€™s $.get method) to query /check to check whether the inputted username is available.

    Recall that you can prevent submission of a form with preventDefault, and you can programmatically induce submission of a form (once validated by you) with submit.


personal touch

Implement at least one personal touch of your choice:

    Allow users to change their passwords.

    Allow users to add additional cash to their account.

    Allow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via index itself, without having to type stocks' symbols manually.

    Require users' passwords to have some number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols.

    Implement some other feature of comparable scope.
