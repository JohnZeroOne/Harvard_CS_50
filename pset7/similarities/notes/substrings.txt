substrings

TODO

take in A and B and N (which is the substring length)

split each string into all subtrings of length n
    e.g: n = 3
         "hello"
         ["hel", "ell", "llo"]
         n = 2
         "hello"
         ["he", "el", "ll", "lo"]

         extract substrings from string
            s[i:j] string splicing
            returns the substring of s from i through to j (not including j)

            may want to write helper function

compute list of all substrings appearing in both A and B

return list
